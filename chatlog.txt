Billing: Billing Questions/Account Management

We've recently renewed our hosting plan service with eHost at the end of last year, then at January 4th we were mistakenly charged once more(by JustHost) for a monthly plan that is almost 4 times more expensive than the one purchased(with eHost).

Hello there, can you help me ?

Hello Lucas, My name is Sheldon and I am happy to help you today.

Could you provide me the primary domain of the account?

omniavita.com.br 

S
Could I get the last 4 characters of the main password to verify ownership of the account, please?

Thank you for Validating.

I see the account is auto renewed at $14.99/month for 1 year, total $179.88

How many domains and email accounts do you have in this account?

L
there's one problem: we weren't at any point noticed about these change and since our host renewal was made at the end of last year, we were to have our domain hosting plan last until 25/12/2018. Why are you charging us without any prior notice/agreement since we've already paid for the service we agreed paying ? And how can we proceed with a chargeback on these $179.88 ?

I do believe the amount of domains and e-mail accounts are somewhat utter irrelevants points, anyway: we have 5 e-mail accounts and 1 domain.

S
I see the account was set to expire on 01/08/2018 , hence the auto renewal of the account was done 15 days prior to the expiration date.
The account is set to auto renewal

this doesn't make sense, as eHost charged us on december 25th of 2017, why is there another billing for a service one has already paid and why were there no prior notices of such increases in the amount paid for the same service ?

S
I see the charge from ehost is not added in this account, please wait, let me check this with a specialist

L
Okay. 
Yesterday we preemptively requested a copy of the receipt from eHosts but they've haven't answered us yet. Neither did JustHost's support.
